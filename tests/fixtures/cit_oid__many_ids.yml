        the only vaccine licensed against tuberculosis, demonstrates variable efficacy
        in humans. Recent preclinical studies highlight the potential for mucosal
        BCG vaccination to improve protection. Lung tissue-resident memory T cells
        reside within the parenchyma, potentially playing an important role in protective
        immunity to tuberculosis. We hypothesised that mucosal BCG vaccination may
        enhance generation of lung tissue-resident T cells, affording improved protection
        against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a mouse model, mucosal intranasal (IN)
        BCG vaccination conferred superior protection in the lungs compared to the
        systemic intradermal (ID) route. Intravascular staining allowed discrimination
        of lung tissue-resident CD4+ T cells from those in the lung vasculature, revealing
        that mucosal vaccination resulted in an increased frequency of antigen-specific
        tissue-resident CD4+ T cells compared to systemic vaccination. Tissue-resident
        CD4+ T cells induced by mucosal BCG displayed enhanced proliferative capacity
        compared to lung vascular and splenic CD4+ T cells. Only mucosal BCG induced
        antigen-specific tissue-resident T cells expressing a PD-1+ KLRG1- cell-surface
        phenotype. These cells constitute a BCG-induced population which may be responsible
        for the enhanced protection observed with IN vaccination. We demonstrate that
        mucosal BCG vaccination significantly improves protection over systemic BCG
        and this correlates with a novel population of BCG-induced lung tissue-resident
        CD4+ T cells.","DOI":"10.1038/s41385-018-0109-1","extra":"PMID: 30446726","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30446726","accessDate":"2019-02-07","author":[["N.

        panel of 40 leading experts in the management of endometrial cancer. Before
        the conference, the expert panel prepared three clinically-relevant questions
        about endometrial cancer relating to the following four areas: prevention
        and screening, surgery, adjuvant treatment and advanced and recurrent disease.
        All relevant scientific literature, as identified by the experts, was reviewed
        in advance. During the consensus conference, the panel developed recommendations
        for each specific question and a consensus was reached. Results of this consensus
        conference, together with a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation,
        are detailed in this article. All participants have approved this final article.","DOI":"10.1097/IGC.0000000000000609","extra":"PMID:
