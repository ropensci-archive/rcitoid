        the only vaccine licensed against tuberculosis, demonstrates variable efficacy
        in humans. Recent preclinical studies highlight the potential for mucosal
        BCG vaccination to improve protection. Lung tissue-resident memory T cells
        reside within the parenchyma, potentially playing an important role in protective
        immunity to tuberculosis. We hypothesised that mucosal BCG vaccination may
        enhance generation of lung tissue-resident T cells, affording improved protection
        against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a mouse model, mucosal intranasal (IN)
        BCG vaccination conferred superior protection in the lungs compared to the
        systemic intradermal (ID) route. Intravascular staining allowed discrimination
        of lung tissue-resident CD4+ T cells from those in the lung vasculature, revealing
        that mucosal vaccination resulted in an increased frequency of antigen-specific
        tissue-resident CD4+ T cells compared to systemic vaccination. Tissue-resident
        CD4+ T cells induced by mucosal BCG displayed enhanced proliferative capacity
        compared to lung vascular and splenic CD4+ T cells. Only mucosal BCG induced
        antigen-specific tissue-resident T cells expressing a PD-1+ KLRG1- cell-surface
        phenotype. These cells constitute a BCG-induced population which may be responsible
        for the enhanced protection observed with IN vaccination. We demonstrate that
        mucosal BCG vaccination significantly improves protection over systemic BCG
        and this correlates with a novel population of BCG-induced lung tissue-resident
        CD4+ T cells.","DOI":"10.1038/s41385-018-0109-1","extra":"PMID: 30446726","libraryCatalog":"PubMed","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30446726","accessDate":"2019-02-02","author":[["N.
